Now that you have git installed, you will need to configure some information about yourself so that commit messages
will be generated with the correct information attached. To do this, use the git config command to 
provide the name and email address that you would like to have embedded into your commits:
Longcommet

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
